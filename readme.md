# 🐍 Python Interview Preparation Roadmap (30 Days)

## Every Morning(6am-8am)

This repository is a **complete Python interview preparation roadmap** designed for:

- Beginners
- ML / AI / Data Science candidates
- Anyone who failed interviews due to weak Python basics

The focus is **INTERVIEW QUESTIONS + PRACTICAL CODING**, not just theory.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Master Python fundamentals asked in interviews
- Gain confidence answering Python questions verbally
- Practice real interview-style problems
- Become Python-strong for ML / AI roles

---

## ⏱️ Daily Time Commitment

**2–3 hours per day

- 📘 Concept learning
- 💻 Coding practice
- 🎤 Interview question practice

---

- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples & Sets
- Dictionaries
- Control Flow (if-else, loops)

---

### 🔹 Week 2: Functions & Logic

- Functions (`def`)
- Parameters & arguments
- `*args`, `**kwargs`
- Lambda functions
- Recursion
- File handling
- List & dict comprehensions

---

### 🔹 Week 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes & Objects
