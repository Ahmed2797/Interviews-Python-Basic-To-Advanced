    "## 1. Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Distribution is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### English Explanation\n",
    "A Normal Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that:\n",
    "- Has a bell-shaped curve\n",
    "- Is symmetric around the mean\n",
    "- Mean = Median = Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "It is defined by:\n",
    "- Mean (μ): center of the distribution\n",
    "- Standard Deviation (σ): spread of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Most real-world measurements naturally follow this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy Example\n",
    "Exam scores:\n",
    "- Mean score = 70\n",
    "- Standard deviation = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Most students score between 60 and 80\n",
    "- Very few students score extremely low or high\n",
    "\n",
    "### 68–95–99.7 Rule\n",
    "- 68% of data lies within μ ± 1σ\n",
    "- 95% of data lies within μ ± 2σ\n",
    "- 99.7% of data lies within μ ± 3σ\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Normal Distribution Appears So Often\n",
    "Many small independent effects combine together to form a normal distribution. This idea connects directly to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML & Data Science Usage\n",
    "- Linear Regression assumes normally distributed errors\n",
    "- Z-score normalization\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing (Z-test, T-test)\n",
    "- Confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interview Notes\n",
    "- Normal distribution helps model natural variability\n",
    "- Many statistical methods assume normality\n",
    "\n",
    "### বাংলা ব্যাখ্যা\n",
    "Normal Distribution হলো একটি bell-shaped এবং symmetric distribution যেখানে:\n",
    "- Mean = Median = Mode\n",
    "- বেশিরভাগ ডাটা mean-এর আশেপাশে থাকে\n",
    "\n",
    "উদাহরণ:\n",
    "- মানুষের উচ্চতা\n",
    "- পরীক্ষার নাম্বার\n",

    "## 2. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem is the backbone of inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### English Explanation\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem states:\n",
    "Regardless of the original population distribution, the distribution of sample means becomes normal when the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n ≥ 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy Example\n",
    "Suppose income distribution is highly skewed.\n",
    "If we:\n",
    "1. Take many samples of size 30\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean of each sample\n",
    "3. Plot all sample means\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting distribution will be normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Clarification\n",
    "- The original data does NOT become normal\n",
    "- The sample itself does NOT become normal\n",
    "- Only the distribution of sample means becomes normal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why CLT is Powerful\n",
    "CLT allows us to:\n",
    "- Perform hypothesis testing\n",
    "- Create confidence intervals\n",
    "- Make population inferences from samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML Usage\n",
    "- Model evaluation\n",
    "- Cross-validation\n",
    "- Sampling-based learning methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interview Notes\n",
    "- CLT works on means, not raw data\n",
    "- Sample size matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### বাংলা ব্যাখ্যা\n",
    "CLT বলে:\n",
    "ডাটা যাই হোক না কেন, যদি sample size বড় হয়, তাহলে sample mean-এর distribution normal হবে।\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Log-Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Log-Normal Distribution appears when data grows multiplicatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### English Explanation\n",
    "A random variable X is Log-Normal if:\n",
    "log(X) follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies:\n",
    "- X is right-skewed\n",
    "- X is always positive\n",
    "- Growth is multiplicative, not additive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy Example\n",
    "Salary growth:\n",
    "- Salary increases by percentage\n",
    "- Over time, this creates right-skewed data\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking log(salary) often makes it normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "- Right-skewed\n",
    "- Long tail on the right\n",
    "- Mean > Median > Mode\n",
    "- No negative values\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML & Data Science Usage\n",
    "- Log transformation for skewed features\n",
    "- Financial modeling\n",
    "- Variance stabilization\n",
    "- Improving linear model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interview Notes\n",
    "- Log transformation reduces skewness\n",
    "- Helps satisfy normality assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### বাংলা ব্যাখ্যা\n",
    "যদি log(x) normal হয়, তাহলে x log-normal হবে।\n",
    "\n",
    "উদাহরণ:\n",
    "- Salary\n",
    "- Stock price\n",
    "- House price\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Power Law Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Power Law describes systems with extreme imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### English Explanation\n",
    "A Power Law Distribution means:\n",
    "A small number of observations are extremely large, while most observations are very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically:\n",
    "P(x) ∝ x^(-α)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy Example\n",
    "- YouTube subscribers\n",
    "- City populations\n",
    "- Website traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "A few entities dominate the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "- Heavy-tailed distribution\n",
    "- No typical average value\n",
    "- Extreme values dominate the behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML & Data Science Usage\n",
    "- Network analysis\n",
    "- Fraud detection\n",
    "- Anomaly detection\n",
    "- Social network modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interview Notes\n",
    "- Mean can be misleading\n",
    "- Focus on tail behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### বাংলা ব্যাখ্যা\n",
    "Power Law-এ:\n",
    "অল্প কিছু মান খুব বড় এবং অনেক মান খুব ছোট।\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Pareto Distribution (80–20 Rule)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pareto Distribution is a specific type of Power Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "### English Explanation\n",
    "The Pareto Principle states:\n",
    "Approximately 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy Examples\n",
    "- 20% of customers generate 80% of revenue\n",
    "- 20% of bugs cause 80% of system failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML & Business Usage\n",
